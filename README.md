(25-5-2025)    if you want to remove ryo yamada from the corner you arent a real ryo yamada fan >:(.  jk  but also you can remove it by going to resource/ui/hudmatchstatus.res   and  going to the bottom bottom lines  and either setting the alpha to 
0 or by setting the xpos to 10000  

(14-6-2025)      If you want to delete the slightly nsfw picture on the score board pictures go to resource/ui/scoreboard.res and the scroll to the bottom. Afterwards go to RyoScore2 image panel and set it either to xpos 100000 or set visible and enabled to 0



Also I HATE EDITING THE SCOREBOARD I HATE IT . WHY DOES IT EXIST WHY WHY WHY WHY .   thats all .... as always be sure to praise ryo and give her all your money


(15-7-2025)    (new note) i've made some pretty good progress :) 
also also also if you want to have a bocchi the rock intro i would recommend going here::  https://gamebanana.com/mods/522685
<br />
to actually make the intro work put bocchi_intro into your custom folder. THATS ALL :))))

As always as i said before be sure to praise ryo and give her all your money :)))
